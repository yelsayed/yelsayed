### 👋🏼 Hey there

For the past 2 years I've been a Senior Fullstack Engineer building [dairah.com](https://www.dairah.com/) which is a workforce management tool in the Middle East.

4 years before that I was the Lead Engineer, and later CTO, of [meddy.com](https://www.heliumdoc.com/) where you can find and book online doctors in Qatar and UAE. The company was acquired in 2021 and is now called HeliumDoc.

I've built some great stuff alongside a bunch of incredible engineers and we've written about it, you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@theyasser/).

[yasser.codes](https://yasser.codes) is my blog site where I'll be writing more and more about different interesting technologies that I built.
